<div id= "Img">(Before starting, I recommend you learn how to solve 
Rubiks cube, because I won't be explaining any algorithims or what they mean.) To solve the pyraminx, you first need to know the structure of the puzzle and how it moves. The top pieces are called corners, there are 4 corners on the puzzle entirely. The pieces you see in the middle there are called middle pieces. There are three middle pieces on one side of the puzzle. The next pieces are the edge pieces. If you were to turn the pyraminx, you would see how it got it's name.<br> <br></div>
  
  
<div class = " how-to"><h1> Setting up the pyraminx cube</h1>
  
  The first thing you want to do to solve the pyraminx cube is make a nuclear sign with the middle pieces.
  When you finish, you should have three middle pieces, of the same color of course, on the same side, so it looks like a nuclear sign. Once you've done that, you should turn all the corners to the corresponding middle pieces. Make it look like this but with the middle pieces.</div>

 <div><h1>Algorithms</h1>The algorithms for a pyraminx cube a bit different than that on a Rubik's Cube, for example, since it has corners, there are also algorithms for the corners. So the algorithm to move the top corner would "u" instead of "U". And to mve it counterclockwise, just do it how you would normally do for a Rubik's Cube but it's with a lowercase letter. Example: "U'" === "u'"</div>
